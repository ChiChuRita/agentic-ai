# Green Agent Setup Complete! ✓

All components of your Math Evaluator Green Agent have been successfully implemented.

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Project Setup ✓

- ✓ Updated `pyproject.toml` with all required dependencies
- ✓ Added: agentbeats, openai, fastapi, uvicorn, python-dotenv, pydantic, requests

### 2. Math Problems Dataset ✓

- ✓ Created `math_problems.json` with 15 custom problems
- ✓ Problems span three difficulty levels: easy, medium, hard
- ✓ Covers: arithmetic, algebra, geometry, percentages, word problems

### 3. Agent Card Configuration ✓

- ✓ Created `agent_card.toml` following AgentBeats standard format
- ✓ Created `launcher_card.toml` for launcher configuration
- ✓ Defined skills: get_math_problem, evaluate_solution, session_management
- ✓ Configured URLs: localhost:8000 (agent) and localhost:8001 (launcher)
- ✓ Specified A2A protocol support and capabilities

### 4. GPT-5 Evaluator ✓

- ✓ Implemented `evaluator.py` with OpenAI GPT-5 integration
- ✓ Smart evaluation that handles:
  - Different solution methods
  - Equivalent forms (0.5 vs 1/2)
  - Partial credit
  - Detailed feedback

### 5. AgentBeats Server Integration ✓

- ✓ Implemented `main.py` with FastAPI servers
- ✓ Agent server endpoints:
  - GET / (info)
  - GET /health
  - POST /get_problem
  - POST /submit_solution
  - GET /problems
- ✓ Launcher server endpoints:
  - GET / (info)
  - GET /health
  - POST /start_session
  - GET /session/{session_id}

### 6. Helper Scripts ✓

- ✓ Created `run_agent.py` to run both servers simultaneously
- ✓ Created `test_agent.py` for automated testing

### 7. Documentation ✓

- ✓ Comprehensive README.md with:
  - Quick start guide
  - Installation instructions
  - API documentation
  - Testing instructions
  - AgentBeats registration guide
  - Troubleshooting section

## 🎯 Architecture Overview

```
White Agents (on AgentBeats)
        ↓
        ↓ Request problems & submit solutions
        ↓
[Launcher Server :8001]
        ↓
        ↓ Manages sessions
        ↓
[Agent Server :8000]
        ↓
        ↓ Get problem / Submit solution
        ↓
[Math Problems Dataset]
        ↓
        ↓ Evaluate solution
        ↓
[GPT-5 Evaluator]
        ↓
        ↓ Return score & feedback
        ↓
White Agents receive evaluation
```

## 🔧 Key Features

1. **Session Management** - Tracks which problems each agent has attempted
2. **Random Problem Selection** - Agents get random problems from the pool
3. **Intelligent Grading** - GPT-5 evaluates solutions with partial credit
4. **Detailed Feedback** - Agents receive scores (0-100) and explanations
5. **Multiple Difficulty Levels** - Easy, medium, and hard problems

## 📖 Usage Example

```python
# Start a session
session_id = launcher.start_session()

# Get a problem
problem = agent.get_problem(session_id)
# Returns: {"problem_id": "3", "problem": "Solve for x: 3x + 7 = 22", "difficulty": "medium"}

# Submit solution
result = agent.submit_solution(session_id, "3", "5")
# Returns: {"score": 100, "correct": true, "feedback": "Perfect! Correct answer."}
```

## 🚀 Ready to Test!

Your green agent is now ready to evaluate white agents on AgentBeats!

Run `python run_agent.py` to start, then `python test_agent.py` to verify everything works.
